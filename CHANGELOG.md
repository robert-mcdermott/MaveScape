# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

MaveScape's first release, wave 1 of the [roadmap](mavescape-spec/roadmap.md): from a
two-population count table to QC, scores checked against Enrich2, an interactive variant-effect
map and a saved, reproducible record. Built slice by slice; this section grows with each.

### Added

- **The program and its window (wave 1, slice 1).** One self-contained program (`mavescape`) for
  macOS, Linux and Windows, x64 and ARM64, that serves its embedded web app on 127.0.0.1 (port
  8820, or the next free one) and opens it in a desktop window. A second launch hands its files to
  the open window. The host, its security (Host-header check against DNS rebinding, same-origin
  API, Content-Security-Policy, cross-origin isolation) and its content-addressed workspace
  library are adapted from CytoWeave 0.8.0; the web app also runs from any static web server, with
  the library in the browser.
- **The workbench shell.** Views in the order of an analysis (Start, Experiment, QC, Score, Map;
  each says what it will do until it is built), a dataset tree, an inspector, a bottom drawer with
  the history of the analysis and the session's log, a status bar, the command palette (⌘K), undo
  and redo, light and dark themes and color-vision-friendly colors.
- **The build commit** in the status bar and `/api/info`: release builds embed it, other builds
  take Go's version-control stamp.
- **Installers** (`install.sh`, `install.ps1`) that check the download's SHA-256 and version, and a
  release workflow that builds six binaries with their checksums.

- **The experiment design (wave 1, slice 2).** A versioned schema (`mavescape-design` v1,
  `docs/schemas/design.v1.json`) and `web/lib/design.js`, which checks a design against its table
  and describes it in plain language. One schema represents two-population, time-series, FACS-bin
  and score-only experiments, samples shared between replicates, tiled libraries (overlapping too),
  several experiments in one table and known differences between a construct and its reference.
  Every column of a table is a sample's or set aside with a reason: none is dropped silently.

### Validation

- Go tests of the host: security headers, foreign Host headers and cross-origin requests refused,
  the library's round trips, files stored under the hash the program computes, range requests,
  folders opened in natural order, every web module embedded.
- `node --test` of the shared modules (seeded random numbers against FNV-1a test vectors and
  their moments, SHA-256, ZIP, color-vision simulation, the workspace document).
- `validation/run.mjs accessibility`: every text-on-surface pair of both themes, with
  color-vision-friendly colors off and on, at WCAG AA contrast (lowest 4.58:1); the palettes and
  status colors apart in protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia; the diverging score maps' two
  ends apart in every vision.
- `validation/run.mjs designs` (wave 1, slice 2): three public MaveDB data sets of different
  designs (GRB2 SH3, two populations; BRCA1 RING, time series with shared inputs and a second assay
  in the same table; factor IX, FACS bins in overlapping tiles), downloaded and checksummed by
  `validation/fetch.mjs`, each described by a design written as data, with no code for any of them;
  every design satisfies the schema and agrees with its data (37 checks).
- `validation/run.mjs enrich2`: reference scores from Enrich2 2.0.2 (`validation/reference/`,
  generated from MaveScape's designs) equal the scoring formulas MaveScape will use, computed
  independently, to 5 × 10⁻¹³; Enrich2 2.0.2 reproduces the BRCA1 replicate scores published in 2017
  to the same precision, which confirms their method (19 checks).
